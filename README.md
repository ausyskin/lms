Intel(R) AMT LMS
================
Intel Local Manageability Service allows applications
to access the Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) firmware via
the Intel Management Engine Interface (MEI).

## Build prerequisites

### Windows

#### ACE
1. Download ACE library from [ACE Download page](http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/).
2. Configure ACE_ROOT environmental variable with download location.
3. Configure ACE_LIB environmental variables with %ACE_ROOT%\lib.
4. Copy ace-config-win.h to ${ACE_ROOT}/ace/config.h - note that Windows LMS requires ACE compiled with WCHAR support.
5. Build ACE library.

#### libxml
1. Download libxml from [GNOME Download page](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/archive/master/libxml2-master.zip') and build it or use prebuilt binary.
2. Configure LIBXML2_LIBRARY environmental variable with compiled library full path.
3. Configure LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR environmental variable with full path to libxml2 include directory.

### Linux

#### ACE
 * You can use the ACE package provided by your distribution (libace-dev package in Debian).
 * Alternatively:
   1. Download ACE library from [ACE Download page](http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/).
   2. Configure ACE_ROOT environmental variable with download location.
   3. Configure ACE_LIB environmental variables with ${ACE_ROOT}/lib.
   4. Build ACE with default Linux configuration [Building and Installing ACE on UNIX](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#unix).

### Cross-platform

#### MeTee library
CMake script downloads the MeTee library sources from [GitHub](https://github.com/intel/metee)
if the library is not found in the system paths (git installation and correct proxy setup are required).
Alternatively, in order to use pre-compiled MeTee one can set the following environment variables:
 * METEE_LIB_PATH to pre-compiled library path
 * METEE_HEADER_PATH to headers path

#### OpenWsman library
The in-tree copy of OpenWsman library is located at CIM_Framework/openwsman/ directory.
The sources are from 2.6.9 version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Openwsman/openwsman) with local modifications:
* Static analysis fixes
* Passwords are stored encrypted on Windows
* CMake build enabled on Windows

#### GoogleTest (only for builds with unit-tests enabled)

For builds that includes unit-tests CMake script downloads googletest from [GitHub](https://github.com/google/googletest).
To skip automatic download one can download it manually to Common/googletest directory.

## Build dependencies

### Windows
* VisualStudio 2017 with CMake support.

### Linux
#### Tools
* cmake
* C++ compiler
* python3

#### Libraries

* gio-2.0 (libglib2.0-dev package in Debian)
* libcurl (libcurl4-openssl-dev package in Debian)
* libxerces-c (libxerces-c-dev package in Debian)
* libnl-3 (libnl-3-dev package in Debian)
* libnl-route-3 (libnl-route-3-dev package in Debian)
* libxml2 (libxml2-dev package in Debian)

##### Optional dependencies for building DBus interface documentation:
* xsltproc
* docbook-xsl

#### NetworkManager or Connman support

LMS utilizes network service for querying the host network parameters, it can work with NetworkManager, Connman, or directly with netlink.
To select network service set CMake flags:
* NETWORK_NM=ON NETWORK_CM=OFF for Network Manager (this is a default one),
* NETWORK_NM=OFF NETWORK_CM=ON for Connman,
* NETWORK_NM=OFF NETWORK_CM=OFF to use netlink directly (with reduced functionality).
You can not set both flags to ON.

## Build

### Windows

Note: The DLL signature check tests Intel(R) signatures, so external build should disable DLL signature check.

1. Create `build` directory
2. Run `cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A <Build_arch> -DIGNORE_DLL_SIGNATURES=YES <srcdir>` from the `build` directory (best to set build_arch to Win32)
3. Run `cmake --build . --config Release --target package -j <nproc>` from the `build` directory to build an archive with all executables and libraries (e.g. lms-1.0.0-win32.zip)

### Linux

#### Debian-base distributions

1. Create `build` directory
2. Run `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr <srcdir>` from the `build` directory
3. Run `make -j$(nproc) package` from the `build` directory to build a Debian package (e.g. lms-1.0.0-Linux.deb)

#### Other distributions

1. Create `build` directory
2. Run `cmake <srcdir>` from the `build` directory
3. Run `make -j$(nproc)` from the `build` directory to build project

## Install

### Windows

1. Unpack bin directory from build-generated archive.
2. Run `lms-installer.bat install` from unpacked archive.

### Linux

#### Debian-base distributions

1. `sudo dpkg -i <generated .deb package>`

#### Other distributions

1. `make install` from the `build` directory

## Debug

### Linux

LMS prints debug logs to syslog with prefix "lms_svc". If syslog filter is installed, messages are routed to /var/log/lms.log

Messages with level WARNING and up are logged by default. Use UNS/linux_scripts/lms_enable_logging_severity.sh script to set desired log level.

LMS service should be restarted to pick up a new log level.

### Windows

LMS prints debug logs to the file, located at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Gms.log. The file is trimmed at service start.

Messages with level DEBUG and up are logged by default. Use UNS/windows_scripts/lms_enable_logging_severity.bat script to set desired log level.

LMS service should be restarted to pick up a new log level.

## Watchdog

The LMS on Linux contains a watchdog ticker service which ticks an AMT watchdog. This service uses device /dev/iamt_watchdog.
Udev script (70-mei-wdt.rules) creates alias named 'iamt_watchdog' for watchdog device with identity 'iamt_wdt'.

The service ticks watchdog if the AMT is provisioned and the mentioned alias is accesible to it.
Ensure that the device alias exists to enable watchdog tick.
Remove the device alias to stop watchdog tick by LMS.

Note: Ubuntu-base systems blacklist watchdog kernel modules if no watchdog ticker running. One should unblacklist mei-wdt module manually.
